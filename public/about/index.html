<p>As Manager of the <a href="http://www.hi.jpl.nasa.gov">Human-Centered Design Group</a> at NASAâ€™s <a href="http://jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, Dr. Scott Davidoff leads design and development of the user interfaces that command all JPL spacecraft. His expertise includes Human-Computer and Human-Robot Interaction, Visualization, and Design.</p>
<p>As a Principal Investigator, Dr. Davidoff researches new ways to more naturally control complex, future space exploration platforms (like the <a href="http://athlete.jpl.nasa.gov/">Athlete rover</a>). Davidoff is also the creator of numerous <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/universal-methods-of/9781592537563/xhtml/ch79.xhtml">lightweight prototyping methods</a> that now form part of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2017.08.003">Design and HCI curricula</a>.</p>
<p>Across his over 25 years of experience, Davidoff has authored over <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NNr46G8AAAAJ">50 research papers</a> including best papers at the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/2317956">2012 ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/designandemotion/">2008 Design and Emotion Society Conference</a>. He has served on the program committees for the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi">ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a> (CHI), the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/dis">ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems</a> (DIS), and the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/tei">ACM Conference on Tangible and Embedded Interaction</a> (TEI). Prior to JPL, Davidoff taught Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to that, he was the Principal Designer at Scott Davidoff Design, where he led advanced development projects for companies like SBC Ameritech, Nortel Systems, and America Online.</p>
<p>His research is funded by grants from the NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/index.html">Space Communications and Networking</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/index.html">Game Changing Development</a> Programs, and the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/innovation_fund/index.html">NASA Center Innovation Fund</a>, as well as by grants from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1017429">National Science Foundation</a> and <a href="http://research.google.com/university/relations/research_awards.html">Google Research</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Davidoff has a Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, and Master&rsquo;s Degrees in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/masters-programs">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Human-Computer Interaction (Practice)</a>, all from <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/scott-davidoff/">Carnegie Mellon</a>. He received his B.A. in <a href="https://english.duke.edu/">English</a> and <a href="https://polisci.duke.edu/">Political Theory</a> from <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>.</p>
